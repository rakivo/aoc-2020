# This is my solutions of [aoc-2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) in Python

> ### Don't know why I chose Python, just having fun solving these things
> ### This enumerated directories from 1 to 25 are days of aoc(who would've thought :))
> ### I'm NOT a Python developer! Coding in Python second time in my life by the way!

## P.S. I've decided that i will change language every 5 days, so: in python directory there's first 5 days of the aoc, in cpp there's 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and so on
