# This is my solutions of [aoc-2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) in Python

> ### Don't know why I chose Python, just having fun solving these things
> ### This enumerated directories from 1 to 25 are days of the AOC(who would've thought)
> ### I'm NOT a Python developer! Coding in Python second time in my life by the way!
> ### Also I'm NOT a C++ developer!
> ### So, lower your expectations :)

## P.S. I've decided that i will change language every 5 days, so: in python directory there's first 5 days of the aoc, in cpp there's 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and so on
